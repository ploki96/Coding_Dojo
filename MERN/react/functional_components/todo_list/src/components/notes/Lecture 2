W2D1 Beginning an App: State, Mapping State, and Building a Component

- Consider two things first:
    - State
    - Component

- Step 1:
    - Get react app up and running (import, export, etc.)
    - Get State and CharacterBox set up
        - Both are essentially doing similar things.
        - They depend on each other:
            - State has to hold information for the CharacterBox
            - CharacterBox has to display the information in State
    - State (App.js):
        - We set useState equal to an empty array by default (we add things later)
        - BUT, when dealing with project where you map things out and intention is to manipulate/add things later, just put in some data at first.
            - Add data based on how you want things to look.

- Step 2:
    - Map out our character state.
    - When mapping something out you pick the array you want to map out. In this case, it is our character state.
        - Pass in two parameters, character/item and i.
            - character/item is singular b/c map is going to display component for every individual character/item.
        - return CharacterBox but also pass in character={character} & key={i} & idx={i}.
            - For character = {character},
                - The left character is how we name the prop --> props.character
                - The right {character} is how we insert the value.
    - Next, pass in the remaining things (checkbox, powers, etc.)
    - Side note: Review ternary operators
