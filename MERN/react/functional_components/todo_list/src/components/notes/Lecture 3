W2D1 Submit Object to Array in State

-Step 1: 
    - Set up new component, Form.js
    - The form state is going to live in the form component and not App.js. Why?
        - It is b/c App.js does not need the form state. It needs the character state b/c both components use it.
    - Since our form will eventually submit something, the only thing obSubmit needs to do is have access to all the characters we already have and setCharacters.
        - We are going to import characters and setCharacters.
            - We are going to pull this state INSIDE of the Form component.
            - This is done in App.js:
                - <Form characters={characters} setCharacters={setCharacters}
                - State and setStates can be given to components but needs to be explicitly passed down to other components.

- Step 2:
    - Create state for our form
        - const [form, setForm] = useState("")
            - useState is set to an empty string by default.
    - Make an onChange for our form.

- Step 3:
    - Create a function/method for submitting our form.
    - event.preventDefault --> When you hit submit on any normal form on a webpage, it expects it is going to take itself to some action.
        - This prevents the page from refreshing/trying to go to another page.
    - Give form the onSubmitHandler function
