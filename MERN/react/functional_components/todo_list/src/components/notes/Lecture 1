PROPER PLANNING IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY!

W2D1 Planning Out Building a React App

- First figure out your components
    - What can be its own component?
        - Part of page that is repeatable and sort of complex
        - One component can be the 'box/rectangle' that holds the information.
        - Another component can be the input area.

- What should be held in state/What should we add as state?
    - Each name has some information that is associated with it.
        - For example, Hulk has a boolean value, attributes/traits, etc.
        - State of charaters would be an array that holds objects.
        - Charaters = [
            {
            name: '',
            isGood: 'boolean',
            powers: []
            }
        ]
    - Each of our characters would match this object and would be a list of these objects.
        - The reason behind this is to help with mapping and adjusting.
        - We can just send over each object into that component, and the component will handle it (displaying it).
            - Would be easy to initialize the values (add a name, rest of the information is added along as we go.)

- Plan for setting this up
    - App.js:
        - Should have our characters state live here.

    - Form.js:
        - Add to list
            - Will have the place for us to put in the form input.
            - All we need to do is pass in the things it needs.
            - Will have its own form state.
            - We will pass in our setCharacters into our form.js.
        - Display list
            - In our main display, our characters state will be mapped out here.

        - We are putting our charater state in App.js because our form needs to add to the character's list and display the character's list.
        - Therefore, since these two sibling components (adding and displaying) need to access the same state, then our state should just live in the parent (App.js).
